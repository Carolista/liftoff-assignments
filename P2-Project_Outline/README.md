# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
With a background in construction, up-and-coming web developer Dave Clark knows well how complex job estimates can be. Often the average homeowner doesn't even know where to begin, or whether they can even afford to hire a contractor in the first place. Dave's new app will give any homeowner the ability to accurately estimate the cost of their renovation, no matter how big or small. Users can customize their project by inputting measurements, choosing the type of materials needed based on the age and existing construction of their home, and adjusting their selections on final finishes like cabinetry and light fixtures. The app will produce an estimated job cost using up-to-date pricing from major home improvement retailers, giving the homeowner a realistic idea of what they will need to spend in order to see their vision come to life--while staying within their budget. 

### Features
1. User login - Each user will have the ability to save their app preferences and project ideas.
2. Up-to-date pricing data - Estimates will be calculated using real price data from retailers like Home Depot.
3. Personalized projects - A user can define and save one or more projects and return to them anytime to make changes and get an updated estimate.
4. (Maybe) Variable material suggestions - The app will help users select the right materials needed based on the age of their home and the existing materials and conditions.

### Technologies
Back end: Java, MySQL, Spring Boot, Hibernate
Front end: JavaScript, Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
New skills will include connecting a Java/Spring back end to a JS/Angular front end, as well as connecting to an API (unless providing sample data only for the MVP). We also need to think through how we might automate material suggestions and where we would get that source data.
